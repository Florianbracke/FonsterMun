// fonsters who decide to group up form a gang
// rename to 'posse'?

// all fonsters are individual by start, but when they meet other fonsters there is a chance based on type, strength and a random chance, that they form a gang.
// if the opponent is crazy strong -> fonster runs
// if the opponent is crazy weak -> fonster eat
// if the oppenent is around same strenght -> maybe work together, same_type || same_specie == higher chance (but definitly not always)
